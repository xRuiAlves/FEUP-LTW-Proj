Deployment instructions:
In order to deploy the website in a gnomo.fe.up.pt, one needs to decompress the ltw32.zip file in the desired folder and run the following script, 
which is present inside the ltw32.zip file:

./server_config.sh <root_path>

where the root_path is the server's root path inside gnomo.fe.up.pt

Example:
To deploy the server in student up2016KXYZW, one needs to extract the ltw32.zip to the public_html folder of user's 2016KXYZW home page.
Then, inside the public_html folder, one needs to run the configuration script:
./server_config.sh "~up2016KXYZW"
The server is now up and running

The script configures the .htaccess file with the necessary environment variables and configures the root path for php files.

To "build" the database, one needs to go the "db" direction (under the public_html folder) and run the following script:
./config_db.sh

This script builds a new database file based on the schema.sql file (containing the database schema) and the data.sql file (containing database "dummie" data).

The website is also live and running under the following hyperlink:
https://web.fe.up.pt/~up201606746/

  The user can also configure it's own profile (biography, profile picture and password) in his/hers profile page
- Story pictures and user pictures -> The website allows users to post stories with pictures
- Various design features:
    - Implemented a custom dynamic masonry layout to display stories

The server is protected (according to all the penetration tests we executed) against the following "mainstream" attacks:
- XSS attacks
- Injection (SQL and others)
- Cross Site Request Forgery (by using csrf tokens to authenticate api requests)
